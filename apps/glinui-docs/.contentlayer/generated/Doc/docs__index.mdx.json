    "raw": "\nGlinUI is a component library built to provide developers with reusable, modular, and scalable components to power modern web applications. It's designed with flexibility in mind, allowing you to integrate with popular frameworks like TailwindCSS, and extend into other platforms or frameworks such as Angular in the future.\n  \n## Vision and Goals\n\nThe core idea behind GlinUI is to offer **high-performance**, **fully customizable** components that serve as the building blocks for your app's user interface. Whether you’re building a landing page, an admin dashboard, or a complex application, GlinUI provides components that are adaptable and easy to integrate.\n\n### Current Features\n\n- **Lightweight Components:** GlinUI components are designed to be lightweight and fast, without compromising on flexibility.\n- **TailwindCSS Integration:** Built with Tailwind in mind, but extensible to work with other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or custom styles.\n- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Full support for SSR, ensuring your apps are SEO-friendly and performant.\n\n### Future Direction\n \nAs the web continues to evolve, GlinUI is built to evolve with it. Here are some of the future plans:\n\n- **Multi-Framework Support:** While GlinUI currently works seamlessly with React, there are plans to extend its support to other frameworks like Angular, Vue, and possibly even non-JS platforms.\n- **CLI Tooling:** A command-line interface (CLI) to easily scaffold, customize, and manage component versions in your project.\n- **Dynamic Theming:** Future versions will allow for dynamic theming, so components can adapt to light/dark mode or user preferences.\n- **Ecosystem Growth:** GlinUI aims to build an ecosystem around it, with a rich collection of templates, blocks, and full-page layouts that you can integrate directly into your project.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nGlinUI believes in creating **developer-first** tools that not only solve problems but also enable creativity. Components should be easy to use, yet powerful enough to handle complex use cases.\n\nWe also believe in the **open-source** ethos: GlinUI will continue to be community-driven, with contributions and feedback shaping its future.\n\n**Why Design Matters**: In today's fast-paced digital world, great design establishes trust between your business and the user. Clean, thoughtfully designed UI components give users confidence in your product. It communicates professionalism and care, and GlinUI strives to provide that trust through consistent, high-quality components.\n\nJust like great design leads to great products, **GlinUI aims to lead developers toward building great interfaces**, one component at a time.\n\nThis library is influenced by modern UI frameworks, while also focusing on future extensibility. Let’s build the future of user interfaces together with GlinUI.\n\n",
